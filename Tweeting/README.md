Tweeting
========

After a friend of mine informed me about the ease of tweeting from a robot, I decided to check it out.

It turns out to be super trivial.



The best way to do this I've seen (between curl and python) is python's twitter library.


## Installation

The following command worked for me (you may need to install **easy_install** first)

```python
sudo easy_install twitter
```
