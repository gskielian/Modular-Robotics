Description and ToDo
====================

In order to perform tasks a human would usually be able to do, we will need to not only make a robotic arm that is controlled by the
main controller, but also give it the eigenbasis -- if you will -- of human arm/hand actions.


## ToDo

1. turning a knob
2. pressing a button
3. holding an object
4. twisting a screwdriver
