Description and ToDo
====================

In order to perform tasks a human would usually be able to do, we will need to not only make a robotic arm that is controlled by the
main controller, but also give it the eigenbasis -- if you will -- of human arm/hand actions.


## ToDo

* turning a knob
* pressing a button
* holding an object
* torque-ing a screwdriver
