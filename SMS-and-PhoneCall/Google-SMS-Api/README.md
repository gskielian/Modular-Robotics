Google SMS Api
==============

This is a completely free service without the "haven't bought me yet" messages we would receive for the ordinary twilio free-tier*.  ([*Unless you are a non-profit](http://www.mydogear.com/articles/523b4a20a97dca6246b16744))

While Google Api's are free from that message prefix, do not try to spam through it in the free tier, they will monitor it and unlike Twilio, the free-tier for Google SMS Api's are not as rigidly defined (Twilio maxes one sms per minute guaranteed, Google SMS Api max = ? -- which is why we will test this shortly)
