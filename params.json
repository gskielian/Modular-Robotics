{"name":"Modular-robotics","tagline":"This project will host some modular solutions to robotic vision, robotic arms, and other integrable sensors and actuators.","body":"### The Idea\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to gather different \"abilities\" which a robot could have, and to have them be modular as possible (so you can simply drop one ability and add another as need be).\r\n\r\nMy most immediate goal is to have a Raspberry Pi && Arduino based platform with basic vision, speech, and movement capability.\r\n\r\n### Main Categories\r\nWe've done some work already getting the repositories \r\n\r\n* Vision with the Pi-Cam\r\n  * Reading Seven Segment Displays\r\n  * Reading Text\r\n* Speech/Messaging\r\n  * Direct Speech (Espeak)\r\n  * Twitter\r\n  * Text/Sms/Phone-Calls Twilio \r\n* Movement\r\n  * Arduino control via py-serial\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
