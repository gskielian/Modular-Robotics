RasPiCam
========


In this implementation, you should first [install the raspberry pi camera](http://thepihut.com/pages/how-to-install-the-raspberry-pi-camera), for which there are already many tutorials.


Afterwards we need to enter the following into the terminal to install the tesseract-ocr (Optical Character Recognition software):

```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

I would also install imagemagick (which will allow us to fine tune the images and get the most out of tesseract):

```bash
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```
