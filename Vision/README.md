Description and ToDo
====================

## Description

The goal of this project, is to be able to automate everyday tasks by creatin a modular entity with basic features:
* Movement
* Robotic Hand with Position Sensing
* Vision with OCR
* Internet Connectivity

Allowing the robot to use tools initially meant for people will allow it to function more generally -- as most interfaces have been optimized in some way to work for people.

In case references are made to it later, my first projects for this robot are:

1. Speaking aloud directions from a list
2. Cooking soup for me 

## Done
* Learned to use RasPiCam
* Worked how to Read LCD from RasPiCam or WebCam with Linux


## ToDo
* 3D print stand for Webcam and Infrared Thermometer
* Establish PySerial link to Arduino (make the arduino the core of the engine)
