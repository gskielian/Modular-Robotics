This is a pricy but small device -- which is really easy to use.

You can directly connect it to a small portable speaker in order to give you arduino a voice.

### Comparison with Raspberry Pi.

| Pros | Cons | Notes |
| :---: | :---:| :---:  |
| really small, can be powered by Arduino | can get same functionality from RPi for less money | I think for situations where a quick or small speech implementation is needed, then these would be good to utilize |
